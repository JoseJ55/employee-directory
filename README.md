# Employee Directory

## Description
A web apllication that gathers data from a database and orginizes the data to
show only imformation that is important or isn't private. The application uses
react to place the information in a table so user are able to read and go
thorugh the data easily. The table can also be filtered in any way the user
wants through name, id, phone and more. Currently, the database needs to have
certian information to orginize the user in the table. The application also uses
axios to get data from an api or a backend servers.

## Usage
A user will need to either use ssh key to copy directory or go to the website 
https://powerful-ocean-41705.herokuapp.com/ to view the application. If user use
ssh key they will need to use "npm install" on the terminal to install all dependencies for the
application. After that, the user will need to enter "npm start" to start the
application on the terminal. Once on the webpage, the application will retrive
data from randomuser.me which will then filter the data and only render the
information that is needed. The user is able to sort the data through the id,
name, email, and phone number.
